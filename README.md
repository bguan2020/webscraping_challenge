### Overview ###
Create a simple web-scraper that extracts some list of text(keywords, titles, articles, etc.) from some website using [BeautifulSoup](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/intro-to-beautiful-soup) or [Selenium](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/selenium-python-tutorial/). If you are new or inexperienced with python, you can also use [webscraper.io](webscraper.io). Websites can be literally anything, from google, facebook, linkedin, etc. From our perspective, we're looking for 

Once you've scraped some information, I'd like you to perform some data analysis of that list. It can be anything, from simple EDA like mapping word counts to some kind of graph or word map to something more complicated like applying NLP and machine learning models to the set. This is an opportunity to be creative - ask your self, what's an interesting way to look at this information, or what's some potentially useful information I can get from this data that maybe is not immediately obvious? If you are having trouble picking something, one thing we're interested in is finding similarity between texts. 


### How to Submit Project: ###
The project is due 3 days from the receipt of this email. Please email brian@scifind.net with the following information to submit your project:

  1. A URL link to your code (scraper + data analysis) on [Github](https://github.com/). Be sure to cite other code if you use it, I do not tolerate taking other people's code without credit. (*Note: Remember to make it publicly accessible so we can see your awesome work :) *)
